-- A large part of any engineer’s job is thinking about both what can go wrong and how to make things  better. Think about the code you’ve created in all of the hours up until now, and for this first exercise, write down at least three ways in which the code could be better. It might be things that can go wrong with the code, or features that would enable people to better enjoy your experience.

-- You might not be able to code the solutions just yet, but you should get in the habit of being critical of the code you’re creating.

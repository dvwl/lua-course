-- Make two pickups: one that makes you smaller and one that makes you larger. Instead of setting three specific sizes, use a multiplier to change the avatar’s current scale.

-- Remember to create a debounce variable to control how fast the person is allowed to grow and shrink. This is one case where if the function is triggered more often than intended, your experience will crash.

-- Tips:
-- You can modify the user’s default scale with the following properties: 
-- Humanoid.HeadScale: Scale of the avatar’s head.
-- Humanoid.BodyDepthScale: Scale of the body’s depth.
-- Humanoid.BodyWidthScale: Scale of the body’s width.
-- Humanoid.BodyHeightScale: Scale of the body’s height.
-- Set up a simple debounce before experimenting with the avatar’s scale to avoid crashes.
-- Save your work before testing! If the avatar’s scale gets too big, it will crash your experience.

-- You are to create a text-based game in the terminal that incorporates various Lua concepts you've learned. Here's an example of a simple text-based adventure game.

-- In this game, players navigate through Lua Land, facing challenges and making choices. The game will utilize the following Lua concepts:

-- 1. Data Types: Use Lua's data types to represent player attributes, items, and game state.

-- 2. Functions: Implement functions for game logic, player actions, and interactions.

-- 3. I/O: Utilise io.write and io.read for displaying text and receiving player input. You may even store game data and configuration to and from a text file.

-- 3. Closures: Store game data and functions within closures for encapsulation.

-- 4. Pattern Matching: Use pattern matching to handle player input and match choices.

-- 5. Metatables and Metamethods: Employ metatables to define custom behaviors for in-game objects.

-- 6. Object-Oriented Programming: Create classes or objects for characters, items, and locations.

-- 7. Garbage Collection: Manage memory usage and cleanup using Lua's automatic garbage collection.

-- 8. Coroutines: Implement coroutines for game events or time-based challenges.

-- How you define Lua Land, what's in Lua Land, who's in Lua Land, the actions that you can do in Lua Land, it's all up to you.

-- Again, you can work in pairs for this.

-- Good luck in Lua Land!

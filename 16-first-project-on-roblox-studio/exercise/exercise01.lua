-- In Roblox Studio, experiment with the creation tools by creating a mini obstacle course. It could be individual parts the player has to avoid, or it could be a lava floor.

-- Tips:
-- Use a single large part and insert a script as you did earlier to turn it into lava.
-- Additional models can be found in the Toolbox; just be aware that some models may already have scripts in them.
-- Donâ€™t forget to anchor all parts and models.
-- If you know how to use the terrain tools, you can work that into your obstacle course as well
